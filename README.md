# Clip-Phone-Stand
Stand for holding a phone about 72mm wide (the phone in the picture is a Moto X4*.  The stand has two positions depending on which side is placed down.  The clip stays attached to the phone so it should work better on uneven surfaces (sofa, rock, bed, etc).  It can be scaled for other phone sizes or to change the angle of the stand.
